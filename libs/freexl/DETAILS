FreeXL is an open source library to extract valid data from within an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet.
FreeXL design goals:

to be simple and lightweight
to be stable, robust and efficient
to be easily and universally portable
completely ignoring any GUI-related oddity
Note that the final goal means that FreeXL ignores at all fonts, sizes and alignments, and most formats. 
It ignores Pivot Table, Charts, Formulas, Visual Basic macros and so on. FreeXL is structurally simple 
and quite light-weight (typically 40-80K of object code, stripped).

FreeXL is licensed under the MPL tri-license terms; you are free to choose the best-fit license between:

the MPL 1.1
the GPL v2.0 or any subsequent version
the LGPL v2.1 or any subsequent version
