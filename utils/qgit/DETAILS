With qgit you will be able to browse revisions history, view patch content
and changed files, graphically following different development branches.
Main features:

 - View revisions, diffs, files history, files annotation, archive tree.

 - Commit changes visually cherry picking modified files.

 - Apply or format patch series from selected commits, drag and
   drop commits between two instances of qgit.

 - Associate commands sequences, scripts and anything else executable
   to a custom action. Actions can be run from menu and corresponding
   output is grabbed by a terminal window.

 - qgit implements a GUI for the most common StGIT commands like push/pop
   and apply/format patches. You can also create new patches or refresh
   current top one using the same semantics of git commit, i.e. cherry
   picking single modified files.
