cat << EOF
Phonon provides a multimedia API for KDE developers while at the same
time giving the users more choices. With Phonon applications don't need
to develop sound engines as Phonon provides them for free. Applications
are written saying what they want and not how they want to do it. This
leaves some room for the user/administrator to customize things.
If you need multimedia functionality in your program, Phonon is for you.
Use it from simple audio playback to full blown video playback with
audio and video effects. Use it to record an audio signal or capture
from a webcam. Use it to concentrate on your program and not on getting
the mediaframework to work for you.
