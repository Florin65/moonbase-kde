KmPlot is a program to draw graphs, their integrals or derivatives. It supports 
different systems of coordinates like the Cartesian or the polar coordinate system. 
The graphs can be colorized and the view is scalable, so that you are able to zoom 
to the level you need.

Features:

    powerful mathematical parser
    precise metric printing
    different plot types
        cartesian
        parametric
        polar
        implicit
        differential
    highly configurable visual settings (plot line, axes, grid)
    export to bitmap format (BMP and PNG) and scalable vector graphics (SVG)
    save/load complete session in readable xml format
    trace mode: cross hair following plot, coordinates shown in the status bar
    support zooming
    ability to draw the 1st and 2nd derivative and the integral of a plot function
    support user defined constants and parameter values
    various tools for plot functions
        find minimum/maximum point
        get y-value and draw the area between the function and the y-axis
