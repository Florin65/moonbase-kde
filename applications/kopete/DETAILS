Kopete is an instant messenger supporting AIM, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo, Jabber,
Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise Messenger, and more. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible
multi-protocol system suitable for personal and enterprise use.

The goal of Kopete is to provide users with a single easy-to-use way to access all of their instant
messaging systems. The interface puts people first, and is integrated with the system address book
to let you access your contacts from other KDE applications.
