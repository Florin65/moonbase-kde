Kopete is an instant messenger supporting AIM, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger,
Yahoo, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise Messenger, and more.
It is designed to be a flexible and extensible multi-protocol system suitable
for personal and enterprise use.
The goal of Kopete is to provide users with a single easy-to-use way to access
all of their instant messaging systems. The interface puts people first, and is
integrated with the system address book to let you access your contacts from
other KDE applications.
