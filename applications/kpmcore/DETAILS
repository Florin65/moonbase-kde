cat << EOF
KPMcore is a library for examining and manipulating all facets
of storage devices on a system:
* raw disk devices
* partition tables on a device
* filesystems within a partition

There are multiple backends so that KPMcore can support different
operating systems, although the only functional backend is the
one for Linux systems:
* sfdisk backend (Linux)
* null backend
