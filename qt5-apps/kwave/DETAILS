With Kwave you can edit many sorts of wav-files including multi-channel
files. You are able to alter and play back each channel on its own.
Kwave also includes many plugins (most are still under development) to
transform the wave-file in several ways and presents a graphical view
with a complete zoom and scroll capability.
