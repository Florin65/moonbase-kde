LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an approach
to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance.
LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of visual layout to the
software.
LyX produces high quality, professional output using LaTeX, an industrial
strength typesetting engine, in the background; LyX is far more than a
front-end to LaTeX, however. No knowledge of LaTeX is necessary to use LyX,
although it will give a user more power.
